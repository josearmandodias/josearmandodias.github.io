##About me 

Hi, i'm José-Armando or José, as you prefer! I'm a junior fullstack developper living in Paris, currently at O'Clock learning the Fullstack JavaScript program. Atfer high school i didn't knew exactly what i wanted for my futur so i went to college and studied english but it didn't worked for me. After that i worked as a Sales Associates in ready-to-wear and luxury brands, and at the same time i was really thinking of what i wanted to do in my life. And my passion for computers and development came back say hello, so here i am!
